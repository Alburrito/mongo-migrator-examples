# Mongo-Migrator examples

This repository contains examples of how to use [Mongo-Migrator](https://github.com/Alburrito/mongo-migrator) to manage the database migrations of a MongoDB instance.

Here you will find:

- **example-project**: An already initialized project with some migrations created.
- **test-project**: The same project as `example-project` but not initialized. It can be used to test the mongo-migrator package. This project includes a README.md file with instructions to initialize the project and create and run new migrations.
